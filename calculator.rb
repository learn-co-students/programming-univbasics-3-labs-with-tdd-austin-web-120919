# test one - adding first_number and second_number.
# second_number cannot be zero.
sum = first_number + second_number

# test two - subtracting first_number and second_number
difference = first_number - second_number

# Test three - multiply first_number and second_number
product = first_number * second_number

# Test four - Divide first_number and second_number
quotient = first_number / second_number
